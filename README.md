## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This is my first time working on this type of project, and it was a good challenge for me. I was able to practice my HTML and CSS skil, and I understood it takes practice upon practice to become a good programmer/developer. Things like responsiveness, overflowing image, transforming image, merging CSS grid and flexbox, display, positioning etc, was more comprehensive while I was working on this project and the internet was my friend honestly.

### Continued development

I will be working on more advance CSS/HTML, because they have a lot of components.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.appbrewery.com/) - This helped me to kick off as a developer. I really liked this teaching pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand some concepts in this project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
